#### Selection Sort
> **Selection sort** is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally 
> performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in 
> certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited. [Readmore](cli.ng/51pBbu)

Thanks, please follow me and show me how to be a better programmer, I really appreciate that
